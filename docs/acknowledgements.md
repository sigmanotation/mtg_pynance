In the Magic the Gathering community, we want to sincerely thank (Scryfall)[www.scryfall.com] for graciously providing API access to its card data. Simply put, without them this package would not exist!

In regards to existing Python projects, we extend thanks to Polars for their amazing dataframe structures.
