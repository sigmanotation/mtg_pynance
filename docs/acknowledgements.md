From the Magic the Gathering community, we want to sincerely thank [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/) for graciously providing API access to its card data. Simply put, without them this package would not exist!

In regards to existing Python projects, we extend thanks to [Polars](https://pola.rs/) for their amazing dataframe structures.
